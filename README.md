About the service
-------------

The service is just a simple person search REST service. It uses an in-memory database (H2) to store the data. You can also do with a relational database like MySQL or PostgreSQL. If your database connection properties work, you can call a REST endpoint defined in ma.novelis.spring.NameSearch.restController.PersonRestController on port 8080. (see below)


You can use this sample service to retrieve a person from database without known his complete name. (see below)

http://localhost:8080/persons/Karim

About Spring boot
-------------------

Spring Boot is an framework that makes it easy to create new RESTful services (among other types of applications). It provides many of the usual Spring facilities that can be configured easily usually without any XML. In addition to easy set up of Spring Controllers, Spring Data, etc.

To view your H2 in-memory datbase
-------------

The 'test' profile runs on H2 in-memory database. To view and query the database you can browse to http://localhost:8080/h2-console. Default username is 'sa' with a blank password. Make sure you disable this in your production profiles.
